A story-driven visual novel about family built in Adventure Game Studio, made in one week for a jam hosted by Portland Indie Game Squad. Team of 6. Ties into a more recent game I made, Waiting for the Loop. I recently completed development of a remake of Throw Me in the River, which can be found in my projects list. More information on this remake can be found at [www.sidegroupgames.com](www.sidegroupgames.com)
