A story-driven visual novel about family built in Adventure Game Studio, made in one week for a jam hosted by Portland Indie Game Squad. Team of 6. Ties into a more recent game I made, Waiting for the Loop. I am currently working on a remake of Throw Me in the River, rebuilt in a new engine with new visuals, music and writing improvements.
