*Solo Project*

![](/assets/images/shifters4.jpg)

A visual novel in which a paranoid scientist with a flair for the dramatic teaches a seminar on the existence of Shape Shifters who live among us. For this project, I worked entirely on my own (I entered this game into the ‘Compo’ category for Ludum Dare). I built Shifters in Adventure Game Studio. Shifters placed #91 in Mood, #118 in Theme and #122 in Humor in Ludum Dare 35.
