A remake of Throw Me in the River, a visual novel I made in 2015. Remake is being redone from the ground up in the Ren'Py visual novel engine with high resolution art, writing improvements and new music. Throw Me in the River ties into Waiting for the Loop's narrative (for more information on _Waiting for the Loop_ visit [Side Group's website](http://sidegroupgames.com){:target="_blank"}) and will be released on Steam and itch.io. More information will be made available as work on the game progresses.
