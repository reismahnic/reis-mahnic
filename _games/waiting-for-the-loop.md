A short form visual novel in which a brilliant computer scientist builds an artificial intelligence that passes as human... but also attracts the attention of the government. Team of 3. Features characters and events from Throw Me In The River and Interstellar Borders, but can be enjoyed and understood without knowledge of either. 

Fully voice acted, with 450+ lines of dialog. Roughly 15 minutes long. An early version of Waiting For the Loop was selected as Pick of the Month on Adventure Game Studio (the engine it was built in) in April 2017. Waiting For the Loop is the first game to be released by my company, Side Group. It is available now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/717830/Waiting_for_the_Loop/){:target="_blank"} and  [itch.io](https://side-group.itch.io/waiting-for-the-loop){:target="_blank"}.
