A hybrid of Survival Horror and RPG in which you exact revenge on the cult that destroyed your life. You must contend with limited resources, strange enemies and an unreliable shopkeep to survive long enough to take down the silent masked cultists. The full game takes roughly 20-25 minutes to play through. The Farm You Grew Up On was made by Reis Mahnic and Jake Weston over the course of two weeks for a game jam hosted by GitHub. It was built in RPG Maker MV. It can be played in browser or downloaded on PC or Mac.
